To update the **deployed** site:
   - In the terminal:
```bash
    npm run deploy
```

To update the **source** code:
   - Add, commit, and push the changes to the repository as usual:
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your message here"
    git push
```

Todo:
- Add blog section. Blogs should be written in markdown and stored in a separate folder.
- Clickable project cards that lead to that specific project's page for more info and general notes on it.
